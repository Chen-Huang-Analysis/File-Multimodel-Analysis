Company Profile

Basic Information
Established in 2002, Taishin FHC is committed to leading its subsidiaries and related companies with innovative business models based on the core values of "Integrity, Commitment, Innovation, and Collaboration" to continue to provide more comprehensive services and innovative products. With high-quality services, we have earned the recognition and trust of society, worked side-by-side with our clients, and become their "Smart Partner". We aim to become a consistent and growing trustworthy financial institution, a role model in corporate governance and social responsibilities, a leader of Taiwan’s financial industry, and a leading brand of the Chinese community.

Global Operation Strategy
In order to establish a complete financial network, accelerate the internationalization of business goals, and strengthen its competitiveness, Taishin FHC completed the merger of Prudential Life Insurance on June 30, 2021 and the name changed to Taishin Life, becoming a comprehensive financial holding company with banking, insurance, and securities services as its three core drivers. Other subsidiaries operate diverse financial services including venture capital, securities investment trust, securities investment advisory, asset management, and leasing.

In terms of overseas deployment, Taishin FHC has targeted the Asia and Pan-Pacific regions, focusing particularly on the ASEAN countries in response to the government’s New Southbound Policy and the financial service needs and business opportunities of overseas Taiwanese businesses. The subsidiary Taishin Bank has submitted an application to the State Bank of Vietnam to establish a branch in Long An, Vietnam, and is currently actively preparing for its establishment. In addition, the representative office in Bangkok, Thailand, the Labuan Branch, and the Kuala Lumpur Marketing Office in Malaysia were established, further expanding the ASEAN market. In 2023, Taishin Bank received the approval of government authorities in Taiwan and Japan to establish a branch in Fukuoka, which is a sub-branch of our Tokyo branch and was opened on April 23, 2024. Furthermore, in order to provide convenient financial services to clients from China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, Taishin FHC not only invested and established a financial leasing company in Nanjing, China through D.A. Finance, a subsidiary of Taishin Bank in the Greater China market, but also successively founded branch offices in Dongguan, Suzhou, Shanghai, Chongqing, Wuhan, etc., with services offered through its operation network in 19 cities of China. Moreover, Taishin Bank also established a Representative Office in Shanghai. Taishin Bank currently has branches in Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan (Tokyo), Australia (Brisbane), and Malaysia (Labuan Branch and Kuala Lumpur Marketing Office) as well as representative offices in Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh City), Myanmar (Yangon), China (Shanghai), and Thailand (Bangkok).

In the future, we will continue to deepen our overseas market deployment. We will replicate Taishin’s high-quality financial services overseas and continue to expand the market with the goal of integrating excellent financial institutions in the Asia-Pacific region.
